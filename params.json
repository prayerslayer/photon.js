{"name":"Photon.js","tagline":"A tiny lightbox tool.","body":"# Photon\r\n\r\nI wasn't quite satisfied with available lightbox tools (such as [fancybox](http://fancyapps.com/fancybox/), [lightbox](http://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox/), [lightbox2](http://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/) and [colorbox](http://www.jacklmoore.com/colorbox/), to name a few). Somehow I always felt they do too much. Too long animations. Next/previous controls that change their position. Spinners that look too playful and don't fit on my page.\r\n\r\nSo here's a really simple lightbox: **Photon**. It puts images of your choice in a lightbox. There are click controls to cycle through the images and they have a fixed position. Alternatively feel free to use your keyboard (arrow keys left/right and escape). Close Photon by clicking on the grey area. That's it. \r\n\r\nAlso: It's tiny. Minified JS and CSS weigh 4 KB combined. Because it's a jQuery Plugin since version 2 it works in ALL of the browsers.\r\n\r\n# Features\r\n\r\n* Puts images in a lightbox\r\n* Browse through images with arrow keys or click targets\r\n* Exit lightbox with click on background or Escape key\r\n* Shows image caption (alt text) if you want to\r\n* Lacks animations for the most part\r\n* Tiny: 4 KB in total after minification\r\n* Works in all browsers that your jQuery version supports\r\n\r\n# Demo\r\n\r\nAvailable [here](http://rawgithub.com/prayerslayer/photon.js/master/demo/index.html).\r\n\r\n# Usage\r\n\r\nSelect your images and call ``Photon`` on them.\r\n\r\n    $( \"img\" ).Photon();\r\n\r\nThat's about it. If you'd like to group certain photos (because Photon cycles them), you need to call ``Photon()`` on every group.\r\n\r\n## Options\r\n\r\nOptions may be passed as an argument:\r\n\r\n    $( \"img\" ).Photon({\r\n\t\tcaption: false\r\n    });\r\n\r\nAvailable options:\r\n\r\n* ``caption`` (boolean): Whether the caption should be displayed or not. Takes the ``title`` or, if unavailable, ``alt`` attribute of the image. Defaults to ``true``.\r\n* ``emptyCaptionText`` (String): What should be displayed if there is no alt text available. Defaults to ``\"No caption\"`.\r\n\r\n# Customization\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to alter Stylus variables in ``src/photon.stylus`` as you wish.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
